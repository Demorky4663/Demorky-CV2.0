   <h1>Step</h1>
  </div>
  <h2>Step 1: collect customer information</h2>
  <p class="ex">The first step in how to introduce potential customers to your enterprise is to establish brand awareness through effective marketing activities. To start this step, you should segment the audience by analyzing their consumption habits and quality. For example: age, gender, hobbies, salary, etc., so you know them and have a clear understanding of their preferences, and you need to attract them when you first contact them.</p>
  <hr>
   <h2>Step 2: Attract them</h2>
  <p class="ex">After marketing activities, the participation part can and must be carried out in a unified way through all communication channels: email, SMS, telephone, social network, etc. However, multi-channel does not mean copying your communication on all media. This is a question of adjusting one's own way of communication according to different communication spaces.
When they reply or comment quickly, they will feel more involved in the brand. For example: friendly jokes, daily jokes, sudden proposals, etc.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Step 3: talk and collect information</h2>
  <p class="ex">This is the step where you really see the benefits of an effective CRM approach. The purpose here is to turn the audience or potential customers into actual customers. For this step, you must be very cautious and conduct extensive research on future customers to provide high-quality service.
A very important part of customer satisfaction is the whole service experience. Due to the new competition, it is more difficult to achieve customer loyalty every day. This is why it is imperative to provide unique value experience.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Step 4: provide high-quality customer service</h2>
    <p class="ex">This is the step where you should really use CRM as a motto rather than a function. After customers receive the transition period of goods or services, understanding the customer's user experience is essential to optimize your quotation and understand what changes need to be made to improve the customer journey and customer experience.
This is a necessary step to maintain consumer relevance. If this measure is not considered, the company may go bankrupt and lose overall profits due to lack of innovation and lack of understanding of consumer trends, making users lose interest in what they provide.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Step 5: scheme establishment</h2>
  <p class="ex">Achieve customer adaptation and satisfaction plan.</p>
